  "Definition": {
    "1":"Graphs and data are visualized based on individual questions",
    "2":"Graphs and data are visualized based on individual students",
    "3":"This is the pre-test; students give justifications for the distractors they did not select",
    "4":"This is the post-test after peer intervention; students are given a sample of the justifications provided by other students",
    "5":"Shows a bar chart to visualize question and individual responses",
    "6":"Show a rug plot to visualize where each student falls based on individual performance",
    "7":"Problems furthest on an axis were answered incorrectly more often; Each dimension relates to a different concept",
    "8":"Students furthest on an axis solved the most problems; each dimension relates to a different pattern of student performance",
    "9":"A concept/group of questions",
    "10":"The question was more often solved correctly by the students that were able to solve the least in this concept",
    "11":"The question was more often solved incorrectly by the students that were able to solve the most in this concept",
    "12":"Shows how each student performed on each question; will reveal how responses differed from pre to post-test",
    "13":"In clustering, we group students who performed similarly on the quiz in the student view, and we group questions that had a similar response pattern across students in the question view",
    "14":"A question's/item's ability to differentiate among students based on how well they know the material being tested",
    "15":"The percentage of students who answered an item incorrectly; ranges from 0.0 to 1.0",
    "16":"An incorrect option for a selected-response item on the test",
    "17":"If a student's new response on the revised quiz was previously incorrect during the initial quiz",
    "18":"If a student's new response on the revised quiz was previously correct during the initial quiz"
