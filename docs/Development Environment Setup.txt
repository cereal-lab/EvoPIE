This file provides instructions to setup a suitable development environment for this project and run the flask app in it.
We consider 4 options;
    [#1]    Run on Linux natively or inside a Linux virtual Box
    [#2]    Run on Windows natively
    [#3]    Run on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux
    [#4]    Run inside a docker Container

Search below the corresponding [#n] tag to jump to that section.


    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[#2]    Run on Windows natively


Download and run the python 3.8 installer from https://www.python.org/.
Tried installing 3.9 instead but as of the writting of these instructions, it
leads pipenv to wonder where 3.8 is and apparently there are issues for it to
install it on its own; i.e. missing tools?

During the installation
    -   Select add python to path just to be done with this
    -   Allow it to bypass the 260 chars MAX_PATH limit after install


Download & run the Visual Studio Code installer from
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

During the installation
    -   Select add to path option


Download & run the git installer from https://git-scm.com/
During the installation
    -   Used version 2.29.2.2
    -   Select VSCode as default text editor for git
    -   Select checkout windows style, commit unix st

After the installation
    -   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    -   git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com


Open VSCode, click the Git tool button on the left-most vertical panel,
select the github repository for the project: cereal-lab/EvoPIE


Finish python setup by running the following commands in the VSCode terminal
that you can open using CMD-`.
See details at https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/
    -   python -m pip install -U pip
    -   pip install --user pipenv
    -   Add the following to the path environment variable
        C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts
 
 
 Setup flask app from the VSCode terminal
    -   Install all the packages specified in pipfile.lock
        pipenv sync
    -   Activate the pipenvironment for the app
        pipenv shell
    -   Run a custom flask command defined in utils.py to tear down & rebuild an empty data base
        flask DB-reboot
    -   Run the server on local host
        flask run 
Now you may open a browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
