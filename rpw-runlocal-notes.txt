* I had to edit the compose file and the docker files to 
  run locally because:
  + Port 5000 conflicts with upnp on my machine
  + The mount locations are different

* So use my docker compose file ... and be careful to to commit the Docker files

* To run:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-rpw.yml  up --build -d  

* To stop:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-rpw.yml  stop

* Check your docker dashboard for logs, or:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-rpw.yml logs
